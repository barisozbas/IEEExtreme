# IEEExtreme

- In this repo you will find some of IEEExtreme programming contest questions's (2017-2018) solutions.

- IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.

- Math Challange gets near 40 points and rest of them are 100 point solutions.
